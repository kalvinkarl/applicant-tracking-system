## Authentication
- In user management i create rules:
    - username: must be grater than 3
    - passoword: must have 8 or more characters with a mix of Lowercase letters, Uppercase letters , numbers & symbols
    - email: must verify before loging into the system.
    - user can send success registration only (2)twice/ day/ device.
    - initially, your role is applicant, only super administrator can change that to anything he wants,
    - but super administrators doesn't anything to do with lost accounts, passwords, or even retrieving it to the users.
    - super administrator can also make a user but only for administrator(human resource user) only.
